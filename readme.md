## Step 2: Setup git: change yout global configs (add name and e-mail, setup core text editor)
To do this step, i used next commands: 
```
$ git config --global user.name AndriiKurapov
$ git config --global user.email andreykawwee@gmail.com
$ git config --global core.editor nano
```
Let's see if it worked
